These scripts allow a user to perform patient specific data entry into 20+ pages of an electronic medical record (Wellsky, aka Kinnser).

When seeing a new patient, one can copy the contents of 1_SOC_ui and paste it into a new script, then save it with a unique filename. In that patient's script, complete the UI with patient specific data. Once completed, open 1_SOC_main and import file and run.

I personally use Mu to use/edit the scripts when working on actual patient data because of how Mu formats incomplete lines. They are super easy to see.
